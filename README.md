# Test for seedtag

## Description:

Entry test, based on my boilerplate https://github.com/OscarGuerreroLopez/node_boiler_plate . Since I didn’t have much time to complete this task I just grabbed this boilerplate to start coding, hope that is ok

The boiler plate includes route handling, error handling, and also logging. I removed the rate limiter with redis just in case you run into issues while trying to execute it.

Hope I didn´t forget anything, I am more used to functional programming as you can see.
But if you guys are more into object oriented I can get used to it, not a problem.

## Run it

You should create an .env file following .example.env although it should run without one.

npm install and then npm run start:dev or start:tsnode

Also you can just build it and run it as it is
